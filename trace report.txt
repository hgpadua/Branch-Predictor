TRACE REPORT

Project 2

A) After running multiple simulations with the trace files provided, when M is fixed at 4 bits(16 entries table of 2-bit predictors) and N varying to 1, 2, 3, and 4, the results in “mcf_trace.txt” showed that as the number of bits in the global branch history is incremented, the misprediction rate increases in percentage. This is due to the number of bits in the global history changing. Although, for the trace file “gobmk_trace.txt”, when the number of the lower part of the program counter bits is the same as the number of bits in the global branch history, the misprediction rate suddenly decreases from continuous growth.

B) After running multiple simulations with the trace files provided, when N is fixed at 4 bits, meaning the history of the last 4 outcomes, and M varying to 4, 5, 6, and 7, the results from the trace file “mcf_trace.txt” showed that as the number of the lower part of the program counter bits increased, the misprediction rate decreases in percentage. Although, for the trace file “gobmk_trace.txt”, the misprediction rate fluctuates in percentage.

C) For each of the trace files provided, when N is 0 and M varies to 4, 5, 6, and 7, the results in the trace file “mcf_trace.txt” showed that when the number of the lower program counter bits increases, the misprediction rate grows in percentage as well, similar to the results in part B. The results from the trace file “gobmk_trace.txt” is also similar in pattern to the results from the same file in part B, besides that the misprediction rate is less.
